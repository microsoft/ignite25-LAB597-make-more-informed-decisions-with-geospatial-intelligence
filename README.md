## 🌍 LAB597: Make More Informed Decisions with Geospatial Intelligence

### Session Description

Join us for a hands-on lab experience where you'll learn to leverage geospatial intelligence using Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro. In this session, you'll work with real-world data to analyze Phoenix school campuses, measuring land-surface temperature and vegetation coverage using satellite imagery and aerial photography. This practical lab will demonstrate how enterprise geospatial data can drive informed decision-making across various industries.

### 📅 Lab Sessions

This lab is offered at the following times (PST):

- **Wednesday, November 19** → 11:45 AM – 1:00 PM PST ([Register](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/LAB597))

### ✅ Prerequisites

**No prerequisites required!** Just bring yourself to the lab session and we'll provide everything you need to get started.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Work with enterprise geospatial datasets through Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro
- Analyze satellite and aerial imagery to extract meaningful insights
- Compute vegetation indices (NDVI) and land-surface temperature from remote sensing data
- Scale geospatial analysis workflows using Azure Databricks
- Apply geospatial intelligence principles to real-world decision-making scenarios
